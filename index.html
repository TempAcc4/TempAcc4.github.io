        <h2>Reasons for raising the age</h2>
        <p>There are several reasons why raising the driving age would be beneficial. Some of these include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Younger drivers have an underdeveloped brain</li>
          <li>Additional time with a learner's permit will help teenagers gain more experience</li>
          <li>It will reduce the number of teenage deaths and injuries on the road</li>
          <li>Teenagers will be forced to walk/bike instead of drive, leading to lower obesity rates and less pollution</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="data">
        <h2>Supporting Data</h2>
        <p>According to Rochester.edu, the brain stops developing at the age of 25, that includes the rational part of the brain. Without this part of the brain being fully developed, teenagers are more likely to get in crashes. The claim that teenagers shouldn't be able to drive is further proven by a study by The American Medical Association. They stated that since 1996 graduated driver licensing has caused 1348 fewer fatal crashes among 16-year-olds but 1086 more fatal crashes among 18-year-olds. This means that there have been at least 300 fewer deaths because the age people have decided to start driving has been pushed back.</p>

      <section id="counterarguments">
        <h2>Counterarguments</h2>
        <p>While there are many reasons to raise the driving age, there are some arguments you may have against my article, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Biking and walking aren’t good substitutes for when teenagers need to be somewhere</li>
          <li>It could lead to increased reliance on public transportation, which may not be available in all areas</li>
          <li>Teenagers are just getting in crashes because they’re new drivers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's important that I address these potential counterarguments. First off, biking and walking is not a full proof method for getting around, but teenagers can use Uber and Lyft or public transportation or even friends/family to get around. As for the increased reliance on public transportation, I gave other alternatives in my previous sentence. Lastly, this is partially true, as the studies in the "Supporting Data" section of the article said, raising the driving age has helped save 300 lives.</p>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>To conclude, the driving age should be raised. It’ll help save lives, and it’ll give teens brains more time to develop. It’ll also save teens lives indirectly and make them more healthy.</p>
