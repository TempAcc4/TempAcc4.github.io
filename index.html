        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This website is dedicated to promoting the idea of raising the driving age. We believe that by raising the age at which individuals can legally begin to drive, we can help to reduce accidents and save lives on our roads.</p>

        <h2>Reasons to Raise the Driving Age</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Younger individuals are more likely to be involved in accidents due to their lack of experience and maturity.</li>
          <li>Raising the driving age would give young people more time to develop the skills and maturity necessary to drive safely.</li>
          <li>It would also reduce the number of teenage drivers on the road, making it safer for all individuals.</li>
